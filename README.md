# InstaLikeButtonFeature
This project demonstrates an Instagram-style like button feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user double-clicks on the image, a heart icon briefly appears to indicate a "like" animation, mimicking the interaction seen on social media platforms like Instagram. It's a simple and interactive UI component that enhances user engagement.
